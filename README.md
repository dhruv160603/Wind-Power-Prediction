### 📌 Wind Power Prediction using Vedic and Gregorian Calendars

This project explores an innovative approach to long-term wind power forecasting by comparing traditional Gregorian calendar-based models with a Vedic lunisolar calendar framework. Using a hybrid **VMD-GPR (Variational Mode Decomposition + Gaussian Process Regression)** model, the study assesses how natural time alignments can improve forecasting accuracy.

* 📅 **Calendars Used**: Gregorian vs. Vedic (lunisolar)
* 📊 **Techniques**: Time Series Forecasting, Signal Decomposition, Gaussian Process Regression
* 📦 **Tools**: Python, R, CleanTS, VedicDateTime
* 🧪 **Evaluation**: MAE, RMSE, R² Score, Correlation Heatmaps
* 📈 **Results**: Vedic-based forecasting showed lower error and more stable month-wise correlation patterns, suggesting better alignment with natural wind behavior.

🔍 This work contributes to renewable energy forecasting by integrating calendar science with modern machine learning and questioning conventional timestamp assumptions.
